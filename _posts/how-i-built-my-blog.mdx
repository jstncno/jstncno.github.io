## Intro

This is the first ‚Äútechnical‚Äù post of my blog, and I think it seems fitting for
it to be about how I built it.

> INFO: This blog is open-sourced! See the
> [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jstncno/jstncno.github.io) üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª

## The Stack

There are a ton of tooling options to choose from when creating a new software
project. Knowing which tools to actually use depends very much on what your
goals are.

I came up with **three** goals when building this blog:

1. **Write articles using Markdown**

    -  I really enjoy writing in Markdown, especially when writing technical
       content. Out of the box, Markdown allows authors to write expressive with
       little overhead. What that means for me is I can just use backticks
       (`` ` ``) to easily format code.

    -  I can also keep all these articles stored in the repo itself, and not have
      to deal with an external CMS. There are some pros and cons to this, but
      seeing as this is still a very small personal blog, I think I can manage
      all my posts manually (for now...).

2. **Add custom functionality to Markdown posts**

    - Being a frontend developer, I enjoy creating fun, interactive content with
      JavaScript. Not sure what those will be yet, but I want the flexibility to
      play with my strengths here. Plus, I think it will make my blog a bit more
      engaging.


3. **Learn a new technology**

    - This is actually huge reason why I continue to develop software, even as
      hobby - I love learning and working with new technologies. It helps keep
      me on my toes. During my day job, we usually don‚Äôt have the room to
      explore the latest new and shiny piece of tech - we typically stick to
      what we know.

    - This is great from a business perspective, since the technologies in our
      stack are backed by large communities and have so far stood the test of
      time. This gets pretty boring on a personal level, though, and continuing
      doing so runs a risk of my current skillset becoming stale. So, learning a
      new technology helps keep me stay on top of the industry trends.


With these goals in mind, I set out to piece my tech stack together. Here‚Äôs what
I came up with .

### Next.js

*This* is the ***new and shiny*** piece of tech that I‚Äôve had my eye on for a
while. With the rise in popularity of server-side rendering (SSR),
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
[stands out in popularity](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/back-end-frameworks/)
among the rest. Most my blog will likely be static content anyways, so I figured
it‚Äôd be a good excuse - err , *use-case* - to experiment and play with.

### MDX

Before I discovered Next.js, I actually first looked up
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the framework for which to build my site,
because I remembered it featuring a way to turn Markdown files into static HTML.
I‚Äôm not a Ruby developer, though, and I wanted to stay in my lane for this one.

It didn‚Äôt take me long to find [Josh Comeau‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/)
article on
[how he built his blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/),
where he explained his use of Next.js and how MDX is his *secret ingredient*.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) extends Markdown by allowing us to embed React code
within it. So, this:

# I'm an H1!

## I'm an H2!

This is a paragraph.

import HelloGradient from './lib/components/hello-gradient';

<HelloGradient />
```

<br />

Turns into this HTML:

```html
<h1>I‚Äôm an H1!</h1>
<h2>I‚Äôm an H2!</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<h1>hello!</h1>
```

Which renders into this:

<br />

# I‚Äôm an H1!

## I‚Äôm an H2!

This is a paragraph.

<HelloGradient />

<HorizontalRule />

In his blog, Josh describes a few libraries for using MDX with Next.js, and
mentions he would be using [Kent C. Dodds‚Äô](https://kentcdodds.com/)
[`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) moving forward. It
seems like a pretty popular library, so I took the liberty to use it as well.

> INFO: The content between `---` is the post metadata and is managed by
> [`frontmatter`](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/), an MDX plugin that
> works right out the box with `mdx-bundler`.


### Tailwind CSS

Yet another shiny new framework that‚Äôs been generating a lot of hype. I usually
use [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/) when developing React
apps, but I still wanted to scratch that *‚Äúlet's learn something new and
trendy‚Äù* itch.

Tailwind CSS poses an interesting new way of managing your styles as a
"utility-first" CSS framework. After working with it for the blog, I realized it
doesn‚Äôt really fit my use case. Tailwind is built to scale design systems.

My blog is trying to do the opposite - I want the flexibility to customize every
component and post I create. It‚Äôs not going to scale to a team of any size, so
it will probably never take full advantage of Tailwind‚Äôs full feature set, but
it was fun to tinker with.

Tailwind did come in handy when structuring the layout of my pages, especially
when it came to making it responsive and mobile-friendly. I also found myself
taking advantage of Tailwind‚Äôs configuration to manage color themes and other
properties that are intended to be used throughout the entire app.

I use [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) to detect the
user‚Äôs current them preference and Tailwind to detect and apply the appropriate
color theme. One limiting thing about Tailwind is that it looks like it only
supports two themes - a `light` mode and a `dark` mode.

I‚Äôve always thought about creating more themes (more than just `light` and
`dark`) for the blog as a creative outlet. When that time comes, I might switch
over to a different CSS framework to better manage multiple themes.

### Styled Components

I‚Äôve configured Tailwind to extend more class styles, but I figured it‚Äôd be
limiting in the future if I wanted to fully customize my styles. At first, I
used [modular SCSS](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) since it came
with Next.js out of the box, but ran into troubles when trying to use it with
`mdx-bundler`.

Apparently, I‚Äôm not the only one - I found
[a](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler/issues/101)
[few](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler/issues/53)
[other](https://www.gbasil.dev/blog/mdx-w-scss)
[developers](https://amitd.co/colophon) who‚Äôve had the same experience.

So, I ended up choosing [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/)
and will be using it going forward for the rest of this blog.
`styled-components` are great because, as its name suggests, I can easily apply
custom styles to my components, which means I can create custom components for
blog posts that may need it.

### Vercel

The stack started with Next.js, so it seems appropriate that it ends with
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The two names are practically analogous to each
other - Next.js is developed by Vercel, and Vercel is a Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS) focused on the developer experience.

Vercel makes it super easy to deploy Next.js apps on their platform. It‚Äôs just a
couple of clicks to sign up and connect your GitHub repo, and a few more steps
to configure your domain. From there, every new commit to your `main` branch is
automatically deployed üöÄ I haven‚Äôt tried any other frameworks (like Angular or
Vue), but I‚Äôm sure the experience is the same.

## Using MDX to Render Blog Posts

I‚Äôve opted for static site generation (SSG) in Next.js for my blog posts, which
means those pages are generated *at build time* and deployed as static HTML
files. Because generated static site pages are built in advance, they provided a
slightly better performance, due to the faster load time from not having to
fetch and render content on the client side.

> INFO: For more info on static site generation, check out
> [this Cloudflare blog](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator)
> on the topic.

The `mdx-bundler` library fit in well with SSG in Next.js - it‚Äôs used to first
convert my markdown content into HTML, then Next.js uses that HTML to create a
React component and generate the final static page that you viewing right now.

SSG is enabled in Next.js if at least one of the following functions are defined
and exported in a
[`Page`](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/pages-in-nextjs)
file: [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props#getstaticprops),
[`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props),
or [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths#getstaticpaths)
(see more on [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes)). Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve defined it for my blog post pages:

### Rendering an MDX React Component

First, I define routes to each available blog post. Each post is identifiable
by it's post ID (`pid`), which is the same as the name of the file it's saved
under.

I load up all the file names of all the posts saved under my `_posts/` directory
in `getStaticPaths` to configure Next.js with these routes:

As you can see with [this post](/blog/how-i-built-my-blog), the **route** is
`/blog/how-i-built-my-blog` and the `pid` is `how-i-built-my-blog`.

```ts
// pages/blog/[pid].tsx
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();

  return {
    paths: posts.map((post) => {
      return {
        params: {
          pid: post.pid,
        },
      }
    }),
    fallback: false,
  }
};
```

A new statically generated `Page` needs to be built for every new route we just
defined. Next.js `Page`s are React components, andlLearning how to use
`mdx-bundler` to render MDX as a React component comes straight
[from the docs](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler/tree/v8.0.0#component-substitution).

For every `pid` (for each of the routes we just created), `getStaticProps` is
called to load a post's MDX code:

```ts
// pages/blog/[pid].tsx
export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }: Params) => {
  const {pid} = params;
  const {code, frontmatter} = await getPost(pid);
  if (!frontmatter.published) {
    return {
      notFound: true,
    }
  }
  return {
    props: {
      code,
      frontmatter,
    },
  };
};
```

Which gets passed into the `Page`'s component as props:

```tsx
// pages/blog/[pid].tsx
export default function BlogPost({code, frontmatter}: MarkdownPost) {
  const Component = React.useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code]);
  return (
    <>
			{/* < ... > */}
      <Component components={{
        h1: H1 as React.FC,
        h2: H2 as React.FC,
        h3: H3 as React.FC,
        p: P as React.FC,
        a: Link as React.FC,
        pre: Pre as React.FC,
        code: Code as React.FC,
        blockquote: Callout as React.FC,
        ol: OrderedList as React.FC,
        ul: UnorderedList as React.FC,
        li: ListItem as React.FC,
      }} />
			{/* < ... > */}
    </>
  );
}
```

You might notice that I'm defining every HTML element I expect to be rendered
out by the MDX component. I did this because each HTML element was rendering
with no styles.

This resulted with articles rendering as a huge slew of words
with no formatting. Even things like lists (`<ol></ol>` and `<ul></ul>`) would
be rendered without numbers, bullet points, or indentation.

I suspect that it might have something to do with how Tailwind hijacks and
strips all styles from elements before applying them through class names. This
is find for me, though, since I think the amount of elements I'd have to style
is decently manageable.

### Loading MDX Files

I currently have all my markdown articles saved into a `_posts/` directory,
where each file name is the `pid` (post ID) of that post. Since Next.js builds
runes in a Node.js environment, we can use native APIs to read MDX files
directly on the filesystem.

Here are the utility functions I created for conveniently reading my
MDX-formatted articles:

```javascript
// lib/utils.ts
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

import { bundleMDX } from 'mdx-bundler';

const POSTS_DIR = path.join(process.cwd(), '_posts');

export interface MarkdownPost {
  pid: string;
  code: string;
  frontmatter: {[key: string]: any};
};

export function getAllPostIds(): string[] {
  return fs.readdirSync(POSTS_DIR)
    .filter(p => p.endsWith('.mdx'))
    .map(p => p.replace(/\.mdx$/, ''));
}

export function getPostMarkdown(pid: string): string {
  const filepath = path.join(POSTS_DIR, `${pid}.mdx`);
  return fs.readFileSync(filepath, 'utf-8').trim();
}

export async function getAllPosts(publishedOnly = true): Promise<MarkdownPost[]> {
  const posts = await Promise.all(getAllPostIds().map(pid => getPost(pid)));
	// Sorted by most recent first
  posts.sort((post1, post2) =>
      post1.frontmatter.publishDate > post2.frontmatter.publishDate ? -1 : 1);
  if (!publishedOnly) return posts;
  return posts.filter(post => post.frontmatter.published);
}

export async function getPost(pid: string): Promise<MarkdownPost> {
  const md = getPostMarkdown(pid);
  const {code, frontmatter} = await bundleMDX(md, {
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    esbuildOptions: options => ({
      ...options,
      target: 'es2020',
      platform: 'node',
    }),
  });
  return {pid, code, frontmatter};
}
```

Now, every time I build my blog, it converts every blog post I've written as a
Markdown document into a static HTML page! When deployed, users will be able to
read my content immediately without having to wait for additional content
rendered by JavaScript and fetched from a separate source.

Actually, since this [GitHub](https://github.com/jstncno/jstncno.github.io)
project is connected to Vercel, I don't have to run any builds myself! Vercel
is like magic with Next.js apps - as soon as I publish to my `main` branch,
Vercel kicks off a build and automatically deploys my site to production üéâ

## Future

Since the [launch of my blog](https://www.notion.so/blog-hello-world-3d29bc43e2c44762a64fef3662f13b37),
I‚Äôm determined on making it an **active** project of mine, meaning I intend to
develop more features in the future as I continue blogging and adding content.

It was actually in writing this post that I realized I needed to style more
components, like the blockquotes and code snippets you see here. I'm sure I'll
come up with new ideas as I move along.

Thanks for reading!
