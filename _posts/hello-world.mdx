Hey there! Welcome to my  blog. My name is Justin, and this is my
developer playground. Here I aim to write about my experiences as a
software developer, both as a profession and as a hobby.

But, why should you care what I have to say? Well, I guess you don't have to, but I should introduce myself anyways.

I have been writing code professionally for about ~7 years now, and I
feel have been some things I've learned that might be worth sharing.
There is also _something_ about coding that I really enjoy - enough so
that it has also been a hobby of mine.

I enjoy crafting software. I think it's rooted in my passion for wanting
to build things, and it's amazing how much one can accomplish by writing
words on a screen.

I've dabbled in a variety of programming topics in my journey as a
software practitioner. You can see from my open source
[GitHub repos](https://github.com/jstncno?tab=repositories) the different
software projects I've created, forked, and contributed to. These past 7
years has been a journey of growth and learning, and yet there is still
so much more to learn grow from.
