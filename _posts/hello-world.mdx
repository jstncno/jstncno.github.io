## Intro

Hello there! Welcome to the very first post of my blog. My name is Justin, and
this blog is my developer playground, where I aim to document about my thoughts
and experiences as a software developer.

## About me

I've been developing software professionally for **\*almost\*** a decade now. My
interests in technology have always lied in the intersection of hardware,
software, design, and interactivity, and I am extremely grateful that the
pursuit of these interests has led me to my current role as a **Technical Lead**
for the **Google Experience Studio**.

At the Experience Studio, we build **Experience Centers** - executive briefing
centers equipped with a suite of **interactive technology exhibits** and other
custom technologies - which host Google's top clients and guests. Our team
doesn't have any official public marketing material, but you can easily search
online and find
[a few](https://thinkwellgroup.com/project/google-the-grove-experience-center/)
[publications](https://www.electrosonic.com/projects/the-grove-google-experience-center)
about the stuff we do (one of our Centers even won a
[LumenWest 2020 Award](https://www.lumenwest2020.com/) for lighting design!).

My role on the Experience Studio is to work with business teams to develop,
integrate, and support technology to help meet their business objectives. If
that sounds a bit too broad and ambiguous, that's on purpose. In truth, the work
activities I do can vary day-to-day - coding, designing technical architectures,
help project planning, even managing stakeholder expectations - but, by far, one
of the coolest things I get to do is help develop interactive technology
exhibits that are deployed in physical spaces. Maybe it'll be worth describing
in another blog one day.

## Why start this blog?

I thought about starting a blog a couple times before, but I didn't think I
would actually go through with it. I mean, I don't claim to be an expert, and I
wouldn't even know what to write about. There were just a bunch of artificial
barriers I was creating for myself that prevented me from taking the time to do
the work.

But recently, I had this sudden urge to create. It was such an overwhelming
feeling that I was compelled to open up a drawing app and start drawing. I don't
even _enjoy_ drawing all that much, but during these few days it was all I did
during my free time.

I was coming up with different "personal brand" ideas and tried drawing
different logo types for them. Now, I'm no artist, and so the best I could do
was the logo that's currently branded on this blog. I still think it looks a bit
"amateur-ish" (well, it _was_ done by an amateur), but I like it because _I_
created it, and I'm a little proud of it since it was produced from outside my
comfort zone. Call it: giving my site a little "personality" üòâ

I also like to build things! I especially enjoy crafting software, even as a
hobby. This blog is yet another thing I get to build, and I plan to use it as a
platform to showcase some of the other stuff I work on.

## Goals

My primary goal for this blog is to keep it as a journal of sorts, where I can
record my programming journey and reflect on my learnings, hoping that what I
write will be helpful to the developer community. It is also intended to be an
ongoing portfolio for me to showcase my work.

I still haven't figured out how I am going to structure my posts - all I know is
that I want to write about something I'm good at and passionate about:
developing software. These posts may come in the form of
_"How I Built X with Y and Z"_, complete with some code examples, or, they might
just be me blabbing or complaining about a niche problem I'm working on. I'll
make it up as we go along, and then see where to go from there. For now, I‚Äôll
focus on web development using TypeScript and Python.

There _is_ also another, slightly more subtle reason for starting this blog.
I've always entertained the idea of pursing an advance degree and have some
prospected dream schools in mind. If ever the time feels right to apply, I hope
I've blogged consistently enough to gain enough credibility and boost my
application.

<br/>
<br/>

So, this post marks the start of my blogging journey. I feel like the best
way to move forward right now is to be consistent with publishing new content,
which will hopefully be enjoyable and provide value.

If you made it this far, thanks for sticking with me, and I hope you'll stay
tuned to future updates! üòÅ
