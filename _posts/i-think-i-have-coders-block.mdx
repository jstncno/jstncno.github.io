**I‚Äôm not a very good writer.**

At least, I‚Äôm not very consistent, which might seem pretty apparent with my blog üòÖ

I started this blog to challenge myself and to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), though I haven‚Äôt really kept up with my own expectations.

Writing isn‚Äôt my natural element - coding is. I‚Äôd much rather be building and experimenting with things through software development.

But, as I sit here and reflect the work I‚Äôve done in the past week, both professionally and as a hobby, I realize that I made it through the week barely writing any code.

Fortunately, my day job doesn‚Äôt require me to be coding 100% of my time. This week was filled with document writing, helping onboard new team members, and meeting with teams to ensure projects continue to progress.

Usually, I‚Äôll be able to fit a few cycles towards fixing bugs or developing new features, but I didn‚Äôt bother to get around to any of that this week. Even during off hours, I barely made progress on any of my side-projects.

I started to reflect on why this is.

<HorizontalRule />

At first, I thought it was attributed to **burnout**. And while I do think I‚Äôm feeling the symptoms of burnout, I don‚Äôt think it paints the whole picture.

I‚Äôve felt burnout before - I once felt it *hard* - and this is not it. I‚Äôm not feeling the grogginess, mental fog, lack of motivation or slight depression that usually comes with it.

Rather, I think I just feel tired from another busy work week. I‚Äôve also been feeling a bit uninspired with my side-projects, probably because I just haven‚Äôt allocated any bandwidth to focus on them.

I think I have **_coder‚Äôs block_**. Like what writer‚Äôs often have, but for coders.

And that‚Äôs *okay*. It‚Äôs unreasonable to expect myself to be a 10x coder 10x of the time. We‚Äôre only human.

One thing I learned about myself is that often I‚Äôll have these waves of high energy and creativity, which I try to capitalize on and be as productive as I can. But those times are sometimes followed by bouts of low-energy days, like what happened to me this week. On days like these, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs best for me to rest and recharge rather than force myself to produce subpar work.

I think I deserve a break. You deserve one too. Before it turns into a *real* burnout.

## We Need Pie

So to get around my *coder‚Äôs block* today, I‚Äôll instead focus on what I set out to do when I [created this blog](https://www.notion.so/blog-hello-world-d39c335ded1b4429b209e6c6abe9b09d) and create more content.

I‚Äôve found that, with any mental block, it‚Äôs best to step away for some time to not think about whatever it is you‚Äôre having problems with. As [Agent K from Men in Black would say](https://youtu.be/1lX7EuWOi5M), *‚ÄúWe need pie‚Äù*.

It may sound silly, but there‚Äôs actually some merit with Agent K‚Äôs rationale for wanting pie during this time of distress with Agent J. And no, it‚Äôs not just because pie is delicious.

## Focused and Diffused Minds

Our brain generally operates in two different modes of thinking: **focused** mode and **diffused** mode. During this mode, the neurons in our brains travel tight paths to try to reach memories and experiences we are familiar with.

### Focused Mode

Our brains enter *focused* mode when, well, we are trying to focus or concentrate on something (like when we are trying to solve a math problem, for example).

### Diffused Mode

Your *diffused* mode of thinking switches on when you're out of *focused* mode.

In this mode, your brain is more relaxed, allowing thought neurons to travel more freely throughout different regions in your brain and may help open you up to new ideas that weren't immediately available from the more constrained mode of focused thinking.

I took the *[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)* course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) some time ago and this is the most important lesson that I‚Äôve taken away from it (the presentation I made for the final project is still [live](http://www.jcano.me/learning-how-to-learn)!).

Understanding *focused* and *diffused* modes has greatly benefitted my work (as well as my career) as a software engineer.

When I get stuck on a complex coding problem, for example, I just take a break! I try to completely disassociate myself with the problem and let my subconscious enter *diffused* mode to do its thing in the background.

By the time I get back to my desk, with enough time blocked off my calendar to get back into *focused* mode, I feel like I‚Äôm ready to see the problem with a fresh new set of eyes.

So, if you‚Äôre stuck on a problem or just having coder‚Äôs block like me, step back and take a break.

Go have some pie ü•ß
